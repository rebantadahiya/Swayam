            <p class="mb-0">I eat so less. Only two chapattis in the morning and one at night. Still I am obese. Why?</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote class="blockquote text-right">
            <p class="lead">This is a problem for many. My advice is that you please make a detail note of everything you eat
               and drink in a day. Then count the actual calorie intake. You will get the answer. It is not just
                about chapattis, but the entire calorie intake.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <p class="mb-0">There are so many stresses. Is it possible to control all? I have tried methods as in some books but failed.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote class="blockquote text-right">
            <p class="lead">The right answer to manage your stress only comes after understanding its basic mechanisms and control.
               This programme gives you practical training to control your stresses. Books cannot be 100% followed until
                you have the right understanding for YOURSELF.</p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <p class="mb-0">Is it important to take my medicines for high blood pressure daily? I only take when I feel my blood pleasure is up.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote class="blockquote text-right">
            <p class="lead">It is very important to take your high blood pressure medicines daily. If you have any doubt that your blood pressure
               is normal, do consult your doctor before stopping medicines. They should not be taken as on occasion schedule.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <p class="mb-0">I know many programmes about diet. Even I have diet charts. So whats new?</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote class="blockquote text-right">
            <p class="lead">It is difficult to follow a diet programme only on papers. It becomes very easy and practical if
               you yourself know about the types of food, calories in your plate, and your requirements. These
                might be different for different people. This programme will give you the basic practical knowledge
                 after which even you will be able to perfectly guide your relatives and friends about their perfect diet.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <p class="mb-0">I am just 28 years old. Is this programme necessary for me?</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote class="blockquote text-right">
            <p class="lead">Yes definitely. This is the age where the blockages grow which actually starts at about 20-
               years of age. The responsible factors can be easily controlled with the right know how. Also
                the stress management makes you happy, increases your work capacity. You can concentrate on your
                 career and achieve all your goals and later on enjoy life to the maximum after all the hard work.</p>
