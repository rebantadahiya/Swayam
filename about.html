            <p class="lead">SWAYAM is based on the concepts pioneered by Dr Dean Ornish for management & reversal of cardiac disease in the 1980s.
               In India, the concept was pioneered by Dr BimalChajjer in Delhi, who was trained by Dr Ornish. Dr Rajeev Sharma has worked
                with and been mentored by Dr Chajjer, whom Dr Sharma believes to be his Guru.

               which all the time tells him to work on removing the unnecessary pain and suffering.</p>
